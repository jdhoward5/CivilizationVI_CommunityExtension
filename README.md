## FAQ

### What does this mod do?
This mod exposes new tools for modders to use by editing Civ VI's base code.

### How does this mod edit the base code?
In essence, the game will load a custom DLL, which then in turn loads the GameCore DLL and makes changes to it. If you want to learn more, join the [Civilization VI Modding Helpline](https://discord.gg/jSVhyBYvZR).

### Is this mod compatible with Mac/Linux?
No. It's possible to port parts of it, but it's just too far out of scope right now.
